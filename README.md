"Mandala Art is a magic circle that holds a great deal of symbolism that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly worlds. When the Sun, Earth and Moon formed a 90Â° âˆ  (right angle), the Sun illuminates more or less than 50% of the Moon and it is know as the Quarter Moon." </p>
  
  
  This art was made using half-circles that look like the First and Third Quarter Phase of Moon embedded with an outline color. Believe me or not, it is really made of half-moons. haha ðŸ˜†
